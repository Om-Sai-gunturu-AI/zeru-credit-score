### Observations:
- Most wallets score between 400–800.
- Wallets with scores under 300 often had high borrow with no repayment or minimal deposits.
- Wallets above 800 had frequent deposits, high repay/borrow ratios, and no liquidation calls.
- Liquidation count had a significant negative impact on scores.
